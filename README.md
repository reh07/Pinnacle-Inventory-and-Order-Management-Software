# Pinnacle (Inventory-and-Order-Mangement-Software-DBMS-Project)
This project aims to create an end-to-end software to enable the functioning of inventory and order processes for an online fashion retail business and provide smooth operation of stocking and delivery.

Large scale warehouses and fulfillment centers have become a norm since the dot-com boom and the emergence of online retail which has transformed the way we shop forever and also gave rise to large-scale warehouses to fulfill the ever-growing consumer demand, managing these huge warehouses and the flow of inventory inside them requires specialized software as it is too big and has lots of moving parts which makes it hard to be managed by a team of employees as it leaves room for error which can potentially delay company operations and cause loss of capital. Therefore, here arises a need for a comprehensive and responsive end to end software solution. 
This softwareâ€™s applications will mainly be based in large warehouses and fulfillment centers. The primary customers for this software suite include online retailers based mainly in the fashion industry who sell a wide range of products. 

The software suite is built by using Python (PyQt5 library) and MySQL database.
 
## Objectives
The goal is to create an Inventory and Order Management System for an Online Fashion Retail company which will:
- To showcase advanced database design concepts
- Demonstrate the use of advanced MySQL database features like functions, procedures, and triggers
-	Enable retaining inventory at an optimum level and never falling below the critical level
-	Eliminate overstocking and understocking problems
-	Enable auto-stocking which ensures more orders can be processed and fulfilled
-	Streamlines the order process, making the entire process more efficient and cost effective.
-	Eliminate clunky and non-responsive software which makes work slow
-	Eliminate the need for multiple software products by including multiple features in the same software suite
